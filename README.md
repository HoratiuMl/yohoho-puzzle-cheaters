# About

This application is a collection of cheats for the game Puzzle Pirates. It is **not a bot**, but a prediction algorithm.

You will have to input the results manually. This has the advantage of being completely ban-proof.

Comes with a command-line interface.

Developed on Arch Linux using MonoDevelop 6.
May or may not work on Windows (It should, but I've not tested it).
